4. **Select Alert Criteria**: Choose the criteria or triggers for alerts.

### Customizing Alert Criteria

Customization is crucial to ensure that alerts are both relevant and actionable. Follow these steps to tailor your alert criteria:

### Testing Your Alert System

Before relying on your alerts fully, it's essential to test the system:

1. **Simulate Transactions**: Create test transactions that meet your alert criteria.
2. **Monitor Alerts**: Ensure that you receive alerts for the test transactions.
