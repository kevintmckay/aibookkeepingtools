## Introduction to AI Bookkeeping Automation

Artificial intelligence has moved from buzzword to baseline in modern finance. Gartner’s 2024 *Finance Digitalization Index* reported that 63% of corporate controllers already use at least one AI-driven bookkeeping workflow, up from just 27% in 2022. Meanwhile, MarketWatch projects the global AI-in-accounting market will grow at a CAGR of **30.1% between 2024 and 2028**, reaching **USD 79 billion by 2028** (MarketWatch, October 2024).

Against that backdrop, advanced [AI bookkeeping automation](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/accounting-standards/1341054/ai-in-accounting-how-to-automate-your-bookkeeping) workflows have become table stakes for CFOs, controllers, and public-practice accountants who want to sharpen margins and deliver advisory-grade insights at scale. This guide upgrades our original 2023 post to premium 2025 standards, adding fresh statistics, real company examples, case studies, pricing tables, and a step-by-step roadmap so that you can move from curiosity to full production.
