### Bank Integration Options

Integrating your AI bookkeeping software with your banking system can be accomplished through several methods:

#### 2. CSV Uploads

If your bank does not offer direct integrations, you can manually download transaction reports as CSV files and upload them to your bookkeeping software.

**Pros:**
- Works with all banks supporting CSV exports.
- Simple and straightforward.

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming manual process.
- Greater potential for errors in data entry.

If you're ready to integrate AI bookkeeping with your banking system, follow these steps:

1. **Evaluate your current bookkeeping system**: Assess what features you need and how they fit your business model.
2. **Choose an AI bookkeeping software**: Consider factors discussed earlier and select a solution that meets your needs.
3. **Link your bank account**: Depending on your integration method, either set up direct feeds or prepare to upload CSV files.
4. **Test the integration**: Ensure that transactions are importing accurately; review a few to verify correctness.
5. **Train your team**: Make sure your employees understand how to utilize the new system effectively.
